            single
            arbitrator pursuant to then current Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The
            arbitrator
            may award any relief available under applicable law including but not limited to an award of attorneys’
            fees, this

            either you or Culturefy intends to seek arbitration under these terms of service, the party seeking
            arbitration
            must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the
            arbitration. Notice to Culturefy should be sent as required by these Terms of Service. The notice must
            describe the
            nature of the claim and the relief being sought. If you and Culturefy are unable to resolve our dispute
            within 30
            days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration. The arbitration, information produced,
            and
            pre-and post-hearing proceedings will be confidential and any award shall not be used in any other case

        <p class="the-general-terms">
            <span class="heading">14.13</span> Class Action Waiver. Any claim must be brought in the respective party’s

            representative,
            multiple plaintiffs, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to
            maintain
            any Class Action in any forum. If the claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator shall not have
            authority to
            combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity
            not a
            party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable,
            unconscionable,
            void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The
            parties
            understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party
            to a
            class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through
            arbitration.
            If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the arbitration agreement in
            Section
            14.12, if otherwise effective, shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief
            only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by
            that party’s individual claim.
